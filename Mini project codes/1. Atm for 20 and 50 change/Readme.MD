**Withdraw Money from ATM**


    We wish to develop a ATM class that will test whether or not a particular number, representing an  amount of cash, can be
    represented as a combination of $20 and/or $50 notes. In your ATM class, you should have one function named run 
    (week 3 content). This function  will take a number which represent an amount of cash as input, and a string as output. 
    and Y $50 notes." when the amount can be dispensed  using X $20 notes and Y $50 notes or "Sorry, the value you input 
    cannot be withdrew".Your program should be able to calculate the value for Xand Y.  If there are multiple ways to 
    dispense an amount, please use the composition with the fewest number of bills.
    
 
 **Output**
 
    For example,
    
        If the input is 60, then the output should be "Here is 3 $20 notes and 0 $50 notes."
        If the input is 100, then the output should be "Here is 0 $20 notes and 2 $50 notes."
        If the input is 120, then the output should be "Here is 1 $20 notes and 2 $50 notes."
