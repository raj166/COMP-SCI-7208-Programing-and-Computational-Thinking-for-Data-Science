## Problem 03 - Shake Hands with constraints
  
    Consider that last Saturday you were at a similar party to Friday. In this party of N couples, only one
    gender (either male or female) can initiate shake hand with everyone. In this problem, you are asked
    to develop a recursive method that calculates how many hand-shakes happened at this party;
 
## Constraints 
    
    -> Signature:
    
        public class ShakingPartyConstrainted
    
    -> attributes:
    
        private nCouples (int): number of couples in the party
        Constructor: ShakingPartyConstrainted(): randomly generate the number of couples in the party
        Constructor: ShakingPartyConstrainted(nTmp): add nTmp to the number of couples in the party
        public int countHandShakes(): this function should recursively count the number of handshakes;
