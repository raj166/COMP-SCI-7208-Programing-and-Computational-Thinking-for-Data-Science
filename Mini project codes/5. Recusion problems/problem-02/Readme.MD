## Problem 02 - Shake Hands

Consider that last Friday you were at a party with several people. In this party of N people, each
person shook her/his hand with each other person only once. In this problem, you are asked to
develop a recursive method that calculates how many hand-shakes happened at this party.

## Constraints 

    -> Signature:

        public class ShakingParty

    -> Attributes:

        private nPeople (int): number of people in the party
        Constructor: ShakingParty(): randomly generate the number of people in the party
        Constructor: ShakingParty(nTmp): add nTmp to the number of people in the party
        public int countHandShakes(): this function should recursively count the number of hand shakes;

    -> Important

      1. The class ShakingParty MUST NOT contain a public static main function.
      2. In order to test your code, you can create another class Test.java and perform your test from this
